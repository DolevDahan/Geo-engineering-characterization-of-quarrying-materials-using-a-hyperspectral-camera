# Geo engineering characterization of quarrying materials using a hyperspectral camera

A MATLAB-based project for analyzing hyperspectral data of quarrying materials, using image processing, feature extraction, and deep learning.
The final objective is to predict geomechanical properties, including UCS, porosity, and water absorption.
The project aims to assist mining and civil engineering industries in evaluating rock quality rapidly and cost-effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **private** and was acquired using a **Specim FX10 hyperspectral camera** in a controlled laboratory environment at the Remote Sensing Lab.

The **Specim FX10** is a high-performance hyperspectral camera that operates in the **visible to near-infrared (VNIR)** range, covering wavelengths from **400 nm to 1000 nm**. It captures detailed spectral information at each pixel, enabling precise material identification and surface analysis.

In this project, the FX10 was used to capture hyperspectral images of rock slabs in a laboratory environment under controlled lighting and calibration. The resulting data provided hundreds of spectral bands per image, which were later used to train AI models for predicting geomechanical properties.

### ðŸ”§ Key Specifications:
- **Spectral range:** 400â€“1000 nm  
- **Spectral bands:** 224 (expandable up to ~330)  
- **Spectral resolution:** ~5 nm  
- **Spatial resolution:** 1024 pixels per line  
- **Frame rate:** Up to 330 Hz  
- **Output format:** ENVI (.hdr + .raw), TIFF

This camera is commonly used in fields such as **geology, agriculture, quality control, and remote sensing**, and plays a central role in enabling **non-destructive rock property prediction** in this study.
