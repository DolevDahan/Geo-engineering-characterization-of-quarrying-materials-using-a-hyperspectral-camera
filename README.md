# Geo-engineering Characterization of Quarrying Materials using Hyperspectral Imaging

## Project Overview

This repository presents **models for characterizing the mechanical properties of rocks** using **hyperspectral imaging and machine learning techniques**. The goal is to provide a fast and cost-effective alternative to traditional laboratory methods used in civil engineering and mining applications.

The project was conducted as part of a B.Sc. graduation project in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

## Objectives

- Replace slow and expensive lab-based rock analysis with a hyperspectral AI-based pipeline.
- Extract dense spectral data using the **Specim FX10** camera.
- Calibrate and process hyperspectral images.
- Train regression models to predict:
  - Compressive strength (UCS)
  - Density
  - Water absorption

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** hyperspectral images were acquired in a controlled remote sensing lab using a SPECIM FX10 camera.
- **Spectral Range:** 400 nm – 1000 nm across 448 bands.
- **Image Size:** 1024 × 225 pixels (uint16).
- **Samples:** 102 different rock samples with mechanical property labels obtained through standard IS3 tests.
